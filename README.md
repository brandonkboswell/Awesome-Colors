#Awesome Colors

By [Brandon K Boswell](http://brandonkboswell.com).

--------------------

**Awesome Colors** *is a collection of excellent colors I've come across while working on projects and browsing the web. Whenever I find a great color or combination of colors I add it to this list.*

## Installation

Clone or copy the sass file into any project you would like to use it in.

## Usage

**Awesome Colors** is just a SCSS file with color variables. Import it into any SASS project and you will instantly gain access to these great color collections.

```
@import "awesome-colors";
```

## Contribute
If you find some excellent combination of colors be sure to send me a pull request. Just namespace the color variable with awesome followed by what collection to add it to and then the color name. For Example: if you find an excellent subtle blue color. The variable name would be:

```
$awesome-subtle-blue : #0B617E;
```
